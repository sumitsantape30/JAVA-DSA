Which of the following data type stores longest decimal number ?

1.long
2.float
3.double 
4.short

Correct Answer: 4.double

Solution Description:
Out of all given options, only float and double can hold decimal
numbers. Size of the float is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes (in most of the
compilers, as the size of data types is compiler specific). So double can
store bigger decimal numbers.
