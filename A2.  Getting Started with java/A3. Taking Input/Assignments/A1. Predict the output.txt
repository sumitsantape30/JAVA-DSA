What is the output of the following code if the input is : 5 10 ?

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = s.nextInt();
int b = s.nextInt();
System.out.println(a+b);

a.5  b.10  c.15  d.error
Correct Answer: 15

Solution Description
"s.nextInt()" scans and returns the next token as int. A token is part of entered line
that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline.
So when input line is : “5 10”, then s.nextInt() returns the first token i.e. “5” as int and s.nextInt()
again returns the next token i.e. “10” as int
