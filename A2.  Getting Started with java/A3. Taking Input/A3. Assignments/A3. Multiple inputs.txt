What is the output of the following code if input is : 10 abc def

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
int a = s.nextInt();
String str = s.next();
System.out.print(a);
System.out.println(str);

a. 10 abc def  b. 10abc  c.10abcdef  d.10 abc

Solution Description
"s.nextInt()" scans and returns the next token as int. A token is part of
entered line that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline.
So when input line is - “10 abc def” then s.nextInt() returns the first token
as int i.e. “10” and s.next() returns the next token "abc”. While printing,
in first statement a is printed and then str. There is no space or nextline
between both print. Hence output is : 10abc.
