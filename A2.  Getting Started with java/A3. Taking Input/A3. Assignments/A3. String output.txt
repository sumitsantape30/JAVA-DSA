What is the output of the following code if the input string is "Career Labs"?

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
String str;
str = s.next();
System.out.print(str);

a. Career Labs  b.Career  c.Labs  d.The above code fragment does not compile

Solution Description
####s.next() returns the next token as String. A token is part of entered line 
that is separated from other tokens by space, tab or newline. So when input 
line is - “Career Labs” then s.next() returns the first token i.e. “Career”
