What is the output of the following code if input is : abc def 10

Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
String str = s.next();
int a = s.nextInt();
System.out.print(str + " " + a);

Options
abc def 10
abc 10
InputMismatchException 
abc InputMismatchException

Correct Answer : InputMismatchException 

Solution Description
"s.next()" scans and returns the next token as String.
A token is part of entered line that is separated from other tokens by space,
tab or newline. So when input line is - “abc def 10” then s.next()
returns the first token as String i.e. “abc” and s.nextInt() tries
to convert the next token i.e. “def” into an int, which gives InputMismatchException.
