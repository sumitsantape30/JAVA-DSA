What is the error in this code?

byte b = 50;
b = b * 50;

Options
1.b can not contain value 2500, limited by its range.
2.* operator has converted b * 50 into int, which can not be converted to byte without casting. 
3.b can not contain value 50.
4.No error in this code

Correct Answer : 2.* operator has converted b * 50 into int, which can not be converted to byte without casting. 

Solution Description
####In 2nd statement, b is multiplied with 50 where b is byte variable and 50 is an integer. So after the multiplication,
result comes as an integer value which is 2500. Now we are trying to assign this integer to a byte variable,
which will cause the error.
