Find the output

public class  Solution{
    public static void main(String [] args)  {
        double a = 6 / 4;
        int b  = 6 / 4;
        double c = a + b;
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}

Options
3.0
1.5
2.0 
2.5

Correct Answer:2.0 

Solution Description
####When 6 / 4 is performed, both the operands of / are integer.
Hence answer will be an int i.e. 1. When we store it in a (which is double),
value of a will be 1.0 and value of b will be 1. Thus a + b will be 2.0.
