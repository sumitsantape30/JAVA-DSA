}

public class StudentUse {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student s = new Student(12);
    s.print();
    }
}   

Answer
null 12

Solution Description: 
####Constructor is called when an object is created, here when we create a Student object coressponding student object is created and rollNo is assigned to 12, whereas name is assigned null (as default value for String data member is null). So output is null 12
