Code: Construct Tree from Preorder and Inorder

For a given preorder and inorder traversal of a Binary Tree of type integer stored in an array/list, create the binary tree using the given two arrays/lists. You just need to construct the tree and return the root.

Note:
Assume that the Binary Tree contains only unique elements. 

Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the size of the list/array. It can also be said that N is the total number of nodes the binary tree would have.
The second line of input contains N integers, all separated by a single space. It represents the preorder-traversal of the binary tree.
The third line of input contains N integers, all separated by a single space. It represents the inorder-traversal of the binary tree.

Output Format:
The given input tree will be printed in a level order fashion where each level will be printed on a new line. 
Elements on every level will be printed in a linear fashion. A single space will separate them.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
