Correct Answer

Solution Description: 15

####“arr” is a reference to the array, which contains address of the array. 
Hence we have passed this address to function “change”. Thus arr and input both refer to the same array.
Hence the statement input[0] = 15 changes the value of element at index 0 of the array to 15.
