Correct Answer: 0
Solution Description
####“arr” is a reference to the array, which contains address of the array. 
Hence we have passed this address to function “change”. 
So input and arr will refer to same array initially, but in the first statement
in function “change” input if made to refer to new integer array. So input[0] = 15, will change the
first element of this newly formed array and the array created in main will remain unchanged.
