        int var2 = 6;
        if ((var2 = 1) == var1)
            System.out.print(var2);
        else 
            System.out.print(var2 + 1);
    } 
    
Options
a.7
b.1
c.2 
d.6

Correct Answer: c.2 

Solution Description:
####Inside if condition, we are actually assigning 1 to var2 and then comparing it with var1.
So, after assignment, var2 becomes equal to 1 and then we are comparing it with var1 whose value is 5.
Both are not equal, hence else part will be executed. ####So the output will be 2,
as var2 was updated to value 1 in the if condition.
